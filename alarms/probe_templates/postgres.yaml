        severity: critical
        response: No automated response will be taken.
        impact: >-
            There is no immediate impact, but if the filesystem fills up,
            service may become severely degraded.  End user requests may
            experience high error rates or increased latency.

            Identify the cause of excessive disk usage and resolve the
            underlying issue.

        response: No automated response will be taken.
        impact: >-
            There is no immediate impact, but if snapshots are not being created
            regularly, then it may impossible to rebuild a Manatee peer and
            restore fault tolerance after a takeover event.  If snapshots are
            not being destroyed, disk space may become exhausted, resulting in
            significant service degradation.

            resolve the underlying issue.

        impact: >-
            There is no immediate impact, but this service is required for
            Manatee rebuilds, which are necessary to restore fault tolerance
            after a takeover event.

        impact: >-
            The daily backup for this metadata shard may be missing.  As a
            result, the garbage collection, auditing, and metering pipelines may
            not have completed.

        impact: >-
            If the shard is completely offline, then end-user requests or job
            tasks operating on objects whose metadata is on the affected shard
            will fail.  If the shard is read-only, then new writes to
            directories on this shard will fail, but read operations and job
            tasks using objects on this shard will be unaffected.  If the shard
            is online for reads and writes, then only its fault tolerance is
            currently affected.
        action: >-
            Determine the scope of the problem and resolve the underying issue.
            See the "manatee-adm" command inside the PostgreSQL zones for
            details.

        title: Metadata shard has experienced a takeover event
        description: >-
            A metadata shard has gone through a takeover transition.  This may
            be because the current synchronous peer took over for a primary that
            it believed had failed, or the current primary peer selected a new
            synchronous peer to replace one that had failed.  See "manatee-adm
            history" on this shard for details.
        severity: minor
        response: No automated response will be taken.
        impact: >-
            During the transition, some end user requests may have failed.  Some
            job tasks may have experienced higher dispatch latency or (in rarer
            cases) failures.  The transition has completed, and there should be
            no ongoing impact.

            If the primary peer has been deposed, then fault tolerance may be
            compromised until that peer has been rebuilt.
        action: >-
            There is likely no immediate action required, but it is recommended
            to verify the health of this shard using "manatee-adm".  You may
            need to rebuild a deposed peer.
