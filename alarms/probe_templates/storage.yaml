            have reduced ability to survive additional failures.  If enough

    # The point of this probe is to identify when storage nodes go down.  For
    # that to be useful, we need to run the check from somewhere else.  We
    # select the "nameservice" zone, on the grounds that there should be at
    # least one per datacenter, and not a whole lot more than that.  It would be
    # better if Amon supported opening alarms when expected checks did not
    # complete successfully.

            If the storage node is down, then Manta will direct writes to other
            storage nodes.  Reads for objects with a copy on the affected
            storage node will be directed to other storage nodes that also have
            a copy of the object, when possible.
        impact: >-
            If the storage node is down, then reads and compute jobs will fail
            when they operate on objects having only one copy that happens to be
            stored on the affected node.
