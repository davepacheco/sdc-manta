        impact: >
            If the problem was transient, there may be no impact.  Otherwise,
            replication may be falling behind.  In that case, recent changes to
            user accounts, sub-users, roles, and ssh keys may not be reflected
            in Manta.  Newly-created accounts, users, roles, and keys may not be
            available, and those that have recently been deleted may still be
            working.  Service is unaffected for accounts, users, roles, and keys
            that have not changed recently.

        description: >
            A periodic ping of an authentication cache's redis instance has
            failed.
        severity: critical
        response: No automated response will be taken.
        impact: >
            Some requests may be failing due to authentication failures.  The
            impact is likely to be proportional to the number of "authcache"
            instances that have experienced this problem.  Note that
            authentication information is cached for a few minutes, so requests
            may not start failing immediately.
        action: >
            Root-cause the failure and resolve the underlying issue.  You may
            need to restart the Redis service.
