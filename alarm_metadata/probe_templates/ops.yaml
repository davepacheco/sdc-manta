        impact: >-
            The jobs database may be getting large, full of job data that is no
            longer needed.  Over time, this can significantly decrease
            performance of compute jobs.
        action: >-
            Check the logs for the job archiver to help debug the underlying
            issue and then repair it.  See also known issue "MANTA-2277".
